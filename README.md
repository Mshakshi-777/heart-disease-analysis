# Heart Disease Prediction 🫀

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes patient health information such as:

- Age, Sex  
- Chest Pain Type (`cp`)  
- Resting Blood Pressure (`trestbps`)  
- Cholesterol (`chol`)  
- Fasting Blood Sugar (`fbs`)  
- Max Heart Rate (`thalach`)  
- Exercise Induced Angina (`exang`)  
- ST Depression (`oldpeak`)  
- And more...

**Target variable**: `target`  
- 1 = Presence of heart disease  
- 0 = No heart disease

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Checked for duplicates
   - Handled missing values (if any)
   - Encoded categorical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distributions of key features
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Insights into relationships between variables and heart disease

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained the following models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Random Forest

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compared models using test accuracy
   - Selected the best-performing model

---

## ✅ Results

- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression  
- **Test Accuracy**: **86.88%**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
